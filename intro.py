# Algorithm Thinking, Peak Finding
# asymptotic complexity?


# one sentence summary - This is about efficient procedures for solving problems with large inputs
# large inputs can be like the human genome, social networks, freeway system US

# efficiency procedures for solving large scale problems 
# we are interested and concerned with scalability

# track what algorithms will do as inputs get larger and larger

# classic data structures: binary search trees, hash tables, balanced binary search trees (invented decades ago)
# augment these data structures

# real implementations in Python
# challenging and worthwhile

# algorithmic thinking: peak finding
# sorting and trees: event simulation
# Hashing: Genome Comparison
# Numerics: RSA encryption, used in SSL, rsa is used in the backend
# Graphs: Rubik's Cube, what's the minimum number of moves to solve 
# shortest path: street map
# dynamic programming: image compression
# Adavanced topics: Complexity
